It's been almost a year since I've written anything and almost as long since I took the blog down. Thanks to the people who messaged me freaking out thinking that the broken keybase proof for my old blog was some kind of canary and I was warning my friends. I'm flattered, actually.

This iteration will be better, I promise. More frequent updates, guest posts, and hopefully a greater mix of content. After discussions with several friends close to me, I have resolved to use this blog as a "weapon of mass instruction" for sharing knowledge, welcoming newcomers to the trade, and inviting others to share what they've learned. I have a good feeling about this, and I hope you find it helpful too.
